
What does Curl -X Post related Thing means

curl -X POST http://localhost:9773/servicemanagement/services/370177fb-e251-545e-8ad2-b68fd9eb0f0d \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d "{\"disableReasons\": [[\"notLicensed\"]]}"

This likely tells the backend:

"Disable this service because it's not licensed."


"curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:9773/privacysetup/privacyGroups/b42746c4-3bf4-5f52-996c-043c0a5bcdd1 -d {\"personalGps\":false,\"personalUser\":false,\"pseudonymousGps\":false,\"personalVehicle\":false,\"anonymousDataNoGPS\":false,}

## 🔍 Breakdown of Each Part

### ✅ `curl`
Command-line tool to send HTTP requests.

### ✅ `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`
Sets the request header to tell the server you're sending JSON data.

### ✅ `-X POST`
Specifies the HTTP method — in this case, `POST`.

### ✅ `http://localhost:9773/...`
The URL you're sending the request to — a local service running on port `9773`.

### ✅ `-d {...}`
This is the **data payload** you're sending in the request body.

## ❌ Issues in the Command

1. **Malformed JSON**:
   - The payload ends with a comma `,` before the closing brace `}`, which is invalid.
   - The escaping of quotes is incorrect for most shells.

## ✅ Corrected Version

Here’s a properly formatted version for **Command Prompt (Windows)**:

```cmd
curl -X POST http://localhost:9773/privacysetup/privacyGroups/b42746c4-3bf4-5f52-996c-043c0a5bcdd1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"personalGps\":false,\"personalUser\":false,\"pseudonymousGps\":false,\"personalVehicle\":false,\"anonymousDataNoGPS\":false}"
```

> Note: `^` is used in Windows CMD to split long commands across lines. You can remove it if you're typing everything in one line.

## 🧪 What This Does

You're sending a POST request to configure privacy settings for a group identified by:

```
b42746c4-3bf4-5f52-996c-043c0a5bcdd1
```

With the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "personalGps": false,
  "personalUser": false,
  "pseudonymousGps": false,
  "personalVehicle": false,
  "anonymousDataNoGPS": false
}
```

This likely disables various types of data collection or tracking for that privacy group.



Sample
POST is Used When Entering a data in Dictionary or List for the first time
C:\Users\Libin Daniel\my-python-app>curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/books -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"id\":3,\"title\":\"New Book\",\"author\":\"Alice\"}"
O/P: {"author":"Alice","id":3,"title":"New Book"}

PUT is Used When Entering a data in Dictionary or List is to be updated  
Note: POST doest work once PUT is used. 
C:\Users\Libin Daniel\my-python-app>curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/books/3 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"title\":\"Book Out of Stock\",\"author\":\"Alice Updated\"}"
O/P: {"author":"Alice Updated","id":3,"title":"Book Out of Stock"}

GET is used to display the element of the dictionary to which it is pointed
C:\Users\Libin Daniel\my-python-app>curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/books/3
O/P: {"author":"Alice Updated","id":3,"title":"Updated Book"}

DELETE is used to detele the element
C:\Users\Libin Daniel\my-python-app>curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/books/3

So if you try to GET the element which you have deleted you will get 
C:\Users\Libin Daniel\my-python-app>curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/books/3
Book not found

Similarly if you try to create a new element using PUT again it shows 
Note we dont have a 6th element in our dictionary but it tried to use "PUT" instead of "POST" to create a new element and this is what I got.
C:\Users\Libin Daniel\my-python-app>curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/books/6 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"title\":\"Book Out of Stock\",\"author\":\"Alice Updated\"}"
Book not found


🔍 Breakdown:

C:\Users\Libin Daniel\my-python-app>curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/books -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"id\":3,\"title\":\"New Book\",\"author\":\"Alice\"}"
1. curl
This is a command-line tool used to send HTTP requests to a server.

2. -X POST
This tells curl to use the POST method — typically used to create new data on the server.

3. http://localhost:5000/books
This is the URL of your Flask API endpoint. You're sending the request to the /books route on your local machine (port 5000).

4. -H "Content-Type: application/json"
This sets the HTTP header to tell the server:

5. -d "{\"id\":3,\"title\":\"New Book\",\"author\":\"Alice\"}"
This is the data payload you're sending in the request body. It's a JSON object with:

JSON
{
  "id": 3,
  "title": "New Book",
  "author": "Alice"
}

The backslashes (\) are used to escape the double quotes so the shell interprets them correctly.

🧪 What Happens When You Run It
Your Flask app receives:

A POST request at /books
With JSON data for a new book
Then it:

Parses the JSON
Adds the book to the books list
Returns the newly added book as a response
